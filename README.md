# Documentation

# Note

This app is using Expo Go:
Expo Go: Expo provides cloud build services, which means you can build your app binaries (APK for Android and IPA for iOS) in the cloud without needing to set up local environments. This is especially beneficial for developers without a Mac, as they can still build iOS applications.
Expo Go: If you start with Expo and later realize you need more flexibility, you can "eject" to a bare React Native project. This allows you to add custom native code and modules.
